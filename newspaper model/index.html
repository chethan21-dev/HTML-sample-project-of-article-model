    <h2>Breaf about AI generative</h2>
    <p>We define AI as the study of
        agents that receive percepts from the environment and perform actions. Each such agent implements a function that maps percept sequences to actions, and we cover different ways to
        represent these functions, such as reactive agents, real-time planners, and decision-theoretic
        systems. We explain the role of learning as extending the reach of the designer into unknown
        environments, and we show how that role constrains agent design, favoring explicit knowledge representation and reasoning. </p>
    <p>We treat robotics and vision not as independently defined
        problems, but as occurring in the service of achieving goals. We stress the importance of the
        task environment in determining the appropriate agent design.
        Our primary aim is to convey the ideas that have emerged over the past fifty years of AI
        research and the past two millennia of related work. We have tried to avoid excessive formality in the presentation of these ideas while retaining precision. We have included pseudocode
        algorithms to make the key ideas concrete</p>

    <p>If the program’s
        input–output behavior matches corresponding human behavior, that is evidence that some of
        the program’s mechanisms could also be operating in humans. For example, Allen Newell
        and Herbert Simon, who developed GPS, the “General Problem Solver” (Newell and Simon,
        1961), were not content merely to have their program solve problems correctly. They were
        more concerned with comparing the trace of its reasoning steps to traces of human subjects
        COGNITIVE SCIENCE solving the same problems. .</p>
    <p>The interdisciplinary field of cognitive science brings together
        computer models from AI and experimental techniques from psychology to construct precise
        and testable theories of the human mind.
        Cognitive science is a fascinating field in itself, worthy of several textbooks and at least
        one encyclopedia (Wilson and Keil, 1999). We will occasionally comment on similarities or
        differences between AI techniques and human cognition. Real cognitive science, however, is
        necessarily based on experimental investigation of actual humans or animals..</p>
    <p>In the early days of AI there was often confusion between the approaches: an author
        would argue that an algorithm performs well on a task and that it is therefore a good model
        of human performance, or vice versa. Modern authors separate the two kinds of claims;
        this distinction has allowed both AI and cognitive science to develop more rapidly. The two
        fields continue to fertilize each other, most notably in computer vision, which incorporates
        neurophysiological evidence into computational models.</p>
    <p>There are two main obstacles to this approach. First, it is not easy to take informal
        knowledge and state it in the formal terms required by logical notation, particularly when
        the knowledge is less than 100% certain. </p>

    <h2>Control theory and cybernetics.</h2>
    <p>The central figure in the creation of what is now called control theory was Norbert
        Wiener (1894–1964). Wiener was a brilliant mathematician who worked with Bertrand Russell, among others, before developing an interest in biological and mechanical control systems
        and their connection to cognition. Like Craik (who also used control systems as psychological
        models), Wiener and his colleagues Arturo Rosenblueth and Julian Bigelow challenged the
        behaviorist orthodoxy (Rosenblueth et al., 1943). They viewed purposive behavior as arising from a regulatory mechanism trying to minimize “error”—the difference between current
        state and goal state. In the late 1940s, Wiener, along with Warren McCulloch, Walter Pitts,
        and John von Neumann, organized a series of influential conferences that explored the new
        CYBERNETICS mathematical and computational models of cognition.</p>
    <p>Cybernetics (1948) became a bestseller and awoke the public to the possibility of artificially intelligent machines.
        Meanwhile, in Britain, W. Ross Ashby (Ashby, 1940) pioneered similar ideas. Ashby, Alan
        Turing, Grey Walter, and others formed the Ratio Club for “those who had Wiener’s ideas
        before Wiener’s book appeared.” Ashby’s Design for a Brain (1948, 1952) elaborated on his
        HOMEOSTATIC idea that intelligence could be created by the use of homeostatic devices containing appropriate feedback loops to achieve stable adaptive behavior..</p>
    <p>Modern control theory, especially the branch known as stochastic optimal control, has
        as its goal the design of systems that maximize an objective function over time. This roughly OBJECTIVE
        FUNCTION
        matches our view of AI: designing systems that behave optimally. </p>
